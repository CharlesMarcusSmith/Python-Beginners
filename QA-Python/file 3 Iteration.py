#1: Write a Python program to find those numbers which are divisible by 7 and multiple of 5, between 1500 and 2700 (both included).
# Num_Store = []                                                                                                                                #This variable is a list []

# for x in range (1500,2701):                                                                                                                   #A for loop using this range function, which loops till 2700, 2701 isn't accepted into loop
#     if (x%7==0) and (x%5==0):                                                                                                                 #Modulo, dividing outputs the remainder, if 0 then we know its a whole number and the number is indeed divisible

#2: Write a Python program to convert temperatures to and from celsius, fahrenheit. Go to the editor
# [ Formula : c/5 = f-32/9 [ where c = temperature in celsius and f = temperature in fahrenheit ]
# Expected Output :
# 60Â°C is 140 in Fahrenheit
# 45Â°F is 7 in Celsius

#     if input_type == 'C':
#         new_temp = (input_temp / 9)*9

#     elif input_type == 'F':
#         return("inputted is F")


# temp_in_temp = int(input("Please input the temperature: "))
# temp_in_type = str(input("Please input temp type - C or F? "))
# temp_result = temp_convert(temp_in_temp, temp_in_type)
# print (temp_result)


#4: Write a Python program to guess a number between 1 to 9. 
# from random import randint
# comp_num = randint(1,9)
# player_guess = input("Please choose a guess a number between 1 and 9")
# if player_guess != comp_num:
#     if playerguess > comp_num:
#         print("Try a little lower")
#     elif playerguess < comp_num:
#         print ("Unlucky, try a bit higher")
# elif player_guess == comp_num

# Exercises
# Create a new python file. In that file create a program that works out a grade based on marks with the use of functions.

# The program should take the students name, homework score (/25), assessment score (/50) and final exam score (/100) as inputs, and output their name and final ICT grade as a percentage.

# Reminder: any inputs and prints should not be included inside the function definition, and should strictly be done outside.

# Stretch goal: Include grade boundaries such that the program also outputs a grade for the student (A, B, etc.)
